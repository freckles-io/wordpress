Note: if you use the wordpress blueprint in combination with Docker/Frocker, the 'frocker build ...' step won't populate the 'wordpress/wp-config.php' file nor the 'wordpress/wp-content' directory, due to the way the underlying 'docker build ...' process works. 

To manually initialize those after the build step (this has to be done only once per project), issue the following command manually:

.freckelize/utils/init_wordpress_blueprint.sh
